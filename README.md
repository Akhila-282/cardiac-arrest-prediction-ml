# Early Detection of Cardiac Arrest in Newborns  
### A Machine Learning and Statistical Modeling Approach  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on the **early detection of cardiac arrest risk in newborn babies** admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU).  
Using **Machine Learning algorithms** combined with **statistical models**, the system analyzes newborns’ vital signs and medical records to predict the likelihood of cardiac arrest, enabling early intervention and improved outcomes.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Develop a predictive model for early detection of cardiac arrest in newborns.  
- Utilize **statistical analysis** and **ML models** for better accuracy.  
- Reduce response time in CICU by providing **early risk alerts**.

## 📊 Dataset  
- **Datasets.csv / labeled_data.csv** → Contains newborns’ vital signs and medical history.  
- Features include: heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, blood pressure, etc.  
- Preprocessing steps: missing value handling, normalization, feature encoding.

## 🧠 Methodology  
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaning, normalization, handling missing values.  
   - Splitting into training and test sets.  

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Extracting statistical features (mean, variance, correlation).  
   - Domain knowledge-based selection.  

3. **Model Training**  
   - ML algorithms: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM.  
   - Statistical validation with performance metrics.  

4. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
